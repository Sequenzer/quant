Williams Alligator Indicator ist a type of [[Crossover|Crossover Strategy]] based on three different [[Definitions#^699f33| moving Averages]] . There are 3 Types:

- Green Moving Average:
	- Length: 5 Periods
	- Offset: 3 Periods into the Future
- Red Moving Average:
	- Length: 8 Periods
	- Offset 5 Periods into the Future
- Blue Moving Average:
	- Length: 13 Periods:
	- Offset: 8 Periods into the Future


### Why are these Indicators that Way?

The Blue Indicator is the "oldest" of these Indicator and should be, based on it's high number of Datapoints, the least reactionary of the three. Whereas the red and green Indciators get increasingly volatile and recent.

When the 3 Indicators are intertwined we conclude there is **no trend in the market**. As soon as the Green and then the Red Indicator is crossing the slower Indicators there might be a Trend forming. I. e. we might want to make a Trade.
