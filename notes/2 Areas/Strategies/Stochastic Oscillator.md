Definition:
The **Stochastic Oscillator** is a momentum indicator that is designed to give you an objective measure of the momentum in your trading instrument.


## Fast Stochastic
Formula: 

$$K(x,y) = 
\frac{C-L(x)}{H(x)-L(x)} *100
$$

Variables:
-	x: Number of Periods you want to conisder 
-	C: Current closing price
-	L(x): Lowest low over x Periods
-	H(x): Highest high over x Periods

There is no real difference when using the same setting for the full and slow stochastic oscillator.Â  The fast (Shorter Period) stochastic is much more reactive and can have a trader a little too active in their trading.
